# April 14

## Side projects:
#### ELK - Elasticsearch, Logstash, & Kibana
  - [x] Set up Elasticsearch and Kibana on machine
    - Elasticsearch running at localhost:9200, kibana running at localhost:5601
  - [x] Install x-pack for both elasticsearch and kibana
  - [x] Work through [Getting Started with Elasticsearch | Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/webinars/getting-started-elasticsearch?elektra=startpage)

  ##### Notes
  - **Kibana:** Visualize data in Elasticsearch
  - **Elasticsearch:** Search engine
  - **Beats & Logstash:** Get data into Elasticsearch

  - Demo App Idea: **Slack Q/A Bot**
    - Q & A slack bot for work.
      - Query "I have a problem..."
      - Use Elasticsearch to match questions with solutions.
      - If there is no solution, user submits query to team.
      - User will be prompted to submit a solution when the team gets back to them.
      - _Additional feature ideas_: Another team member must approve question & solution write-up before the Q & A is added to the database.
    - **Problem**: As of May 15th, can't connect to Slack using IRC and CMPP Gateways - how to get Slack data?

#### Alexa Skill
  - [x] Read [Develop an Alexa Skill in under 5 minutes - Alexa Skills Kit](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit/alexa-skill-quick-start-tutorial)
    - AWS account is suspended, not sure why. Opened a case with AWS Customer Support.

## Theory/coding practice:
- [x] Cracking the Code Interview (1-2 hours)
